# NUTS Platform V2

NUTS Platform allows FSPs to easily create and activate new financial instruments and deactivate existing financial instruments in a trustless and transparent fashion.

Once a new financial instrument is activated, NUTS Platform allows makers to create new issuance of selected financial instrument, using the financial instruments implemented by FSP as an initial instrument template. NUTS Platform also allows takers to engage the issuances created by makers.

To learn more about NUTS platform, please refer to the [NUTS documentation](https://docs.nuts.finance/).

To run the test cases, start a local network using Ganache on port 7545, and run:
```
truffle test
